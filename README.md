traytop
=======

traytop is a GNOME Shell extension that moves all your tray icons to
the top panel, where they belong.

Features
--------

* No configuration needed; all tray icons are moved.
* Tray icons that are hidden by default are still hidden
  (e.g., Network Manager which is replaced by the native Shell icon).
* Tested in GNOME Shell 3.4.2 (Debian wheezy).

Installation
------------

First, download the extension:

    cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
    git clone https://github.com/polof/traytop.git traytop@polof.github.com

Then, enable the extension in gnome-tweak-tool and restart GNOME Shell
(Alt+F2 and "r").
